title: Neu.ro Head of Product at MLOps.community
description: How to leverage ML tooling ecosystem
---
Last Wednesday, Mariya Davydova, Head of Product at Neu.ro, took part in a regular online meetup of an MLOps.community, with a topic “How to leverage ML tooling ecosystem”. In this talk, she has demonstrated an example of an ML project development and production workflows which we have built on top of our proprietary core - Neu.ro - using a number of open-source and proprietary tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Tensorboard, FileBrowser, PyCharm Professional, Cookiecutter, Git, DVC, Airflow, Seldon, and Grafana. She has described how we integrate each of these tools with Neu.ro, and how we can improve these integrations.

Take a look at her lecture [here](https://youtu.be/kZ4F48Er__k) or listen to a [podcast](https://anchor.fm/mlops/episodes/27-How-to-Leverage-ML-Tooling-Ecosystem--Mariya-Davydova---Head-of-Product-at-Neu-ro-eh00l2).

[MLOps.community](https://mlops.community/) was founded in response to the cancellation or postponement of many tech industry conferences in early 2020, such as GTC, KubeCon and MLOps Days, due to the global outbreak of COVID-19. It is an open and transparent community where all are welcome to participate, modelled on a [Kubernetes SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/README.md#governance). It is a place for MLOps practitioners can collaborate on experiences and best practices around MLOps (DevOps for ML). Having broad experience in ML and AI, Mariya Dadydova is a board member at MLOps.community, sharing her expertise with a broad community.
